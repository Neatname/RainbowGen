 * A record of image generation for the RainbowGen program. It contains all
 * necessary information about a given image to recreate it, namely the x and y
 * coordinates, color, and order the pixels were populated in. The record is
 * stored in chunks. The chunks are represented as Strings. Each pixel within
 * each chunk is represented by hex values in the form XXXYYYCCCCCC where the Xs
 * are the hex equivalent of the x coordinate, the Ys of the y, and the Cs are
 * the hex value of the color. The order of the pixels is the order in which
 * they were added to the ImageRecord with lower-index chunks holding earlier
 * pixels.
